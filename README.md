In this project, using **NextJS**(version 13) with **TailwindCSS**, a simple blog page is created that tracks my personal programming projects on Data Science and Web development. Each blog post is written in *Markdown* and then stored in a folder, *blogposts*. 

Additionally, the nav-bar includes my **LinkedIn** and **GitHub** links

- gray-matter (gets the markdown content for a blog post stored in an *.md* file)
- remark remark-html (convert the markdown blog post into html code to display)
